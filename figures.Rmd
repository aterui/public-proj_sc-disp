**Figure 1** Locations of study streams (dotted rectangles) in the upper Savannah River basin in South Carolina, USA. Waterways (lakes and streams) are shown in black and forested areas are gray.  Photos show study species from the top to the bottom; bluehead chub (*Nocomis leptocephalus*), creek chub (*Semotilus atromaculatus*), and striped jumprock (*Moxostoma rupicartes*). Photo credit: S. Kim.

**Figure 2** Parameter estimates of the Bayesian dispersal model. Median estimates (points) and the associated 95% credible intervals (error bars) were reported. Colors distinguish species.

**Figure 3** Estimated mean dispersal distance in relation to body size and high flows. Panels distinguish species, while colors represent the presence-absence of high flows (flow events exceeding the 99th percentile of daily water levels). Shades indicate 95% credible intervals of estimated mean dispersal distance. Triangles indicate 20, 50, and 80th percentiles of total body length. See Figure S4 for dispersal kernels.
